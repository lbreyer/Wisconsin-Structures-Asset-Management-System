# Wisconsin-Structures-Asset-Management-System
The Bureau of Structures (BOS) needs analysis tool for analyzing and forecasting potential roadway structure maintenance needs.

Project Description:
The Wisconsin Department of Transportationâ€™s (WisDOT) Bureau of Structures strives to maximize the useful life of bridges in a cost effective manner through approving federal funding toward preventative upkeep and maintenance projects on existing roadway structures. This process vastly decreases the likelihood of these structures developing major flaws or defects due to the natural wear cycle. It also significantly reduces the risk of catastrophic structure failure. As both of those occurrences represent a extremely large repair cost on top of a notable time investment, the preventative maintenance cycle works to improve the longevity of roadway structures while reducing overall construction costs.

The Wisconsin Structures Asset Management System serves primarily as a needs analysis tool for the preventative maintenance program. Its work action analysis allows it to forecast future maintenance needs based on modern, standardized deterioration model projections and using a number of rules based on the bridge's National Bridge Inventory ratings. Based on the outcome, WiSams then outputs suggested future maintenance work, ideal work timeframes, and projected project costs allowing the BoS to plan for and approve future upkeep work projects.

My Role:

Similarly to my work with the Wisconsin Structures Certification Tool, I functioned as the back-end developer on the summer 2021 update and maintenance process for this project focusing mainly on refactoring the overall structural architecture of the application's code into a version of MVC framework designed for Windows Forms Apps.

The goal of reorganizing the code structure in this update was to divide the concerns of the project into the MVC components. By doing this, we allow for simplification of simultaneous development through separation of components with the hope of improving scalability as we further expand the application's functionality going forward.

In addition to my direct work on the application, I also researched and developed a standard model and guide to the style of MVC framework we would be using going forward as a coding team. Documentation I developed for this modified version of the MVC framework can be found below.
